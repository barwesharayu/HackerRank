The first line has a double,  (the cost of the meal before tax and tip).
The second line has an integer,  (the percentage of  being added as tip).
The third line has an integer,  (the percentage of  being added as tax).

Output Format

Print the total meal cost, where  is the rounded integer result of the entire bill ( with added tax and tip).
